## Assignments & Project

There will be regular homework assignments, typically as part of lab sessions. There will also be a final term project; more details about which will be forthcoming.

## Textbook

We will be drawing material from a wide variety of sources for this course; as such, there is no single, required text book <em>per se</em>. However, we will frequently refer to Nathan Yau's <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781118462195-4"><em>Data Points</em></a>, and highly recommend that anybody taking this class have a copy. Additionally, many lab sessions and some assignments will use exercises from Nathan Yau's <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780470944882-0"><em>Visualize This</em></a>. Tamara Munzer's <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/"><em>Visualization Analysis and Design</em></a> is also incredibly useful.
